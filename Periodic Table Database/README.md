# Periodic Table Database

This project aims at checking whether a certain prompt is a valid element of the Periodic Table and if it is already in the SQL database. If it is not, the user should get `I could not find that element in the database.`; otherwise, if the input is in a valid form, one should be returned the information regarding said element.

The script which checks the validity and presence of the element is in the `element.sh` file, while the database is in `periodic_table.sql`.

### Solution:

The script is in the `element.sh` file, while the corresponding database is in `periodic_table.sql`.
