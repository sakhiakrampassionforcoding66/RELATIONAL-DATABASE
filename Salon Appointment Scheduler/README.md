# Salon Appointment Scheduler

This project consists in creating a ledger with all the appointments to a salon. The is greated by a service menu, which should list all the available services at the salon. Next, the user is asked to choose a valid service, followed by a phone number. If the phone number is not registered in the databse, then a prompt appears so as to capture the clients' name, which is subsequently added to it. After this point, a date is requested and, finally, the appointment is added to the ledger.

The relevant files for this project are the `salon.sh` and `salon.sql`files.

### Solution:

The script is in the `salon.sh` file, while the corresponding database is in `salon.sql`.
