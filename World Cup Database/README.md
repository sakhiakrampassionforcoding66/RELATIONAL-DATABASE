# World Cup Database

This project is built around the `games.csv` file, which is a comma-separated list of all the games of the final three rounds of the World Cup tournament since 2014. 

There are two parts to the this project:
* Build a database consisting on the info on the `.csv` file;
* Query the database for relevant information.

The database must comply with a list of properties:

So as to comply with all of the previous topics, the `insert-data.sh` script was created, which will be properly expained bellow.

Regarding the second phase of the project, another script, `queries.sh`, outputs the pretended results (which are in the `expected_output.txt` file).



### Solution:

For the first part, check `insert-data.sh`; as for the remaining, `queries-sh` should be considered.
